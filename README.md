# Browser Extensions
This repository contains browser extensions, primarily for Chrome.

Within the `browser-extensions` directory, there are subdirectories specific to each browser, such as `chrome-extensions`.

Each extension will be located inside its respective subdirectory within its own folder. For example, you will find the voice notes extension inside `chrome-extensions/voice-notes-extension`.

## How to Use the Extensions

1. Download the folder containing the extension (e.g., `voice-notes-extension`).
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the specific extension folder (e.g., `voice-notes-extension`).
5. Usage-specific details for each extension can be found within the respective extension's folder.
